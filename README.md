Assignment source code for finding the 10 largest words in a file.

1.     Obtain C tools that work reliably. Use the strictest standards-conforming mode you can find, and do not use any nonstandard compiler extensions. Eliminate as many compiler warnings as you can. We prefer that you use either C89 or C99. If you must use C++ use basic features, and avoid use of STL.

2.    Find a newline-delimited word list file. On Linux or MacOS systems this would typically be the file /usr/dict/words or /usr/share/dict/words. You may also be able to find a similar word list on the internet as the open source project "yawl-0.3.2" or similar.  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eneko/data-repository/master/data/words.txt is one list. Your word list file should not contain duplicate words.

3.     Write a one-file C program. Name it (first_name)_(last_name)_longest.c. Your program should print out the 10 longest words from that file.  Words can be printed in any order, and if there are multiple words tied for 10th longest you can decide what to do.  This is intended to be a fairly quick exercise -- we are not looking for polished code.

4.     Please send your code and how much time you spent to make it work (not including set up time).
